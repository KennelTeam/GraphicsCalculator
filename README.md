# GraphicsCalculator

This project was intended to become a simple analog of [desmos](https://desmos.com/calculator) but in fact it is not working as good as we were expecting :)

## Features that work

- Custom formula processing (building structure based on brackets, signs, etc.)
- Simple graphic displaying (but with some problems with grid density)
- Conversion text formula into LaTex view

Sounds like it has all required features, right?

In fact there are plenty of bugs which we didn't fix because of lack of time :(
